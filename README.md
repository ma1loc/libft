## Introduction  
**Libft** is a project developed as part of the curriculum at [1337 School](https://www.1337.ma).  
It involves recreating standard library functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, and others, while also implementing utility functions for string manipulation, linked lists, and memory management.  

The purpose of this project is to strengthen understanding of C programming fundamentals and prepare students for more advanced coding challenges.

## Features  
- **Part 1: Libc Functions**  
  - Reimplementation of standard C library functions, such as:  
    - `ft_strlen`  
    - `ft_strcpy`  
    - `ft_memset`  
    - `ft_memcpy`  

- **Part 2: Additional Functions**  
  - Useful helper functions not included in the standard C library, like:  
    - `ft_substr`  
    - `ft_strjoin`  
    - `ft_split`  

- **Part 3: Bonus Part**  
  - Functions to handle linked lists:  
    - `ft_lstnew`  
    - `ft_lstadd_front`  
    - `ft_lstclear`
